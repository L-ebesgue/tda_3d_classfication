This project aims to give a brief hands-on experience at a real-world application of persistent homology. The dataset you will work with is the Non-Rigid World Tosca database of 3D shapes. This database has 148 different shapes represented as geometric simplicial complex from different classes of creatures (dogs, cats, horses, gorillas, etc.). 

There can be multiple shapes of the same creature with different poses among those 148 shapes. The ultimate goal is to discriminate between the different creatures using persistent homology, regardless what pose they may be in.
